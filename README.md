# Project 3 Food Demand 
This project is about understanding people's choices about what food to eat (and how much). Sometimes these choices may lead to inexpensive, nutritious diets, but certainly not always! In examining demand, we focus on the relationship between diet, budget, and prices. The overall goal of the project is to be able to give a clear characterization of this relationship for some particular real-world population.
