# Project 3 Food Demand - Tanzania's Nutritional Transition

## Topic
In this project we are examining the connection between income growth, consumer demand, and nutritional intake in Tanzania: a case study of the period 2008-2014.

## Goals
- Complete a holistic analysis of population, health, nutrition, economy, and climate trends in Tanzania, with a comparative study of 2008-2014 datasets.
- Develop a demand model to analyze the relationship between income fluctuations, consumer preferences, and food demand.
- Assess the long-term impacts of nutritional intake and food demand changes in Tanzania, considering future projections such as GDP growth, climate change, and agricultural changes.
